ICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

To complete the mobile app setup, you need to generate two icon files:

1. icon-192x192.png - 192×192 pixel icon for Android devices
2. icon-512x512.png - 512×512 pixel icon for high-resolution displays

You can generate these icons using the included tools:

1. Open the placeholder-icon.html file in your browser
   - This file contains a simple icon generator tool
   - Click the "Generate Icons" button to create a new icon design
   - Use the "Download 192x192" and "Download 512x512" buttons to save the icons

2. Alternatively, open the icons-info.html file for more information about creating icons
   - This file provides guidelines and links to online icon generators

3. Place both icon files in the root directory of the project (same location as index.html)

Once you've created the icons and placed them in the project directory, the mobile app will use them automatically when installed on a device.

Note: The service worker and manifest.json files have been configured to use these icon files for the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality.
